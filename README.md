# KST-Milestone-1

The game in question is Pop Culture Trivia. Players will enter their name, and pick from 5 categories (Movies, Music, TV, Literature, & Random). From there, they will answer the multiple question presented on the tile. 

A correct response will gain the corresponding player 1 point. An incorrect response will allow the opposite player to steal. If both players answer incorrectly, the space is left open to try again. Whoever has the most at the end wins.
