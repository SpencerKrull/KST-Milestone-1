The game in question is Pop Culture Trivia Bingo. Players will enter their name, and pick from 5 categories (Movies, Music, TV, Literature, & Random). From there, they will answer the multiple question presented on the tile. 

A correct response will place the corresponding player's marker on the space. An incorrect response will allow the opposite player to steal. If both players answer incorrectly, the space is left open to try again.

A bingo will result in a win. However, if neither party manages a bingo, the one with the most squares filled wins.
